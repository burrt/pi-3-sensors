# Raspberry Pi 3 simple projects

Below will be some simple Rasberry Pi 3 projects I'm pursuing on an on-going basis!
So far the list is:

* Simple LED test loop
* Simple temperature sensor reading
* Simple use of 7-seg display
* Simple use of LCD screen
* Simple shutdown button

Future projects that are more interesting:

* Multi-sensor display (real-time graphs etc.)
* Weather prediction (haha..)

They will most likely be in their own separate repositories due to their scope.

## Electronics list

* DS18B20 digital thermometer - waterproof
* DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor
* HD44780 equivalent LCD controller
* Standard collection of resistors, capacitors, LEDs, 7-seg blocks, wires etc.

Future components:

* Speakers
* Motion sensor (gesture capture)
